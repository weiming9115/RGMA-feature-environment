-----------------
feature_list.json
-----------------
- assign whether the feature was tracked in time or identified 
- if tracked --> set "isfeature_track" = True
- if identified at a single time --> set "isfeature_track" = False

- assign whether the feature is spatially bounded (a 2-D binary mask of the feature) 
- if bounded --> set "isfeature_mask" = True

- assign "track_data" that will be read as input and a copy of it will be saved. 
- assgin the "box_size_degree", which indicates the size of looking window of each frame
  centered on the feature centroid.

------------------
variable_list.json
-----------------

***** note ******
The variable directory should be structured by year and the file name should include clear time information
,for example, "/YYYY/era-5_variable_YYYY.MM.nc" or "/YYYY/era-5_YYYY.MM.DD.nc" or "/YYYY/GPM-IMERG_YYYY.MM.DD.mm.nc".

- assign variables that will be extracted and included in the feature-environment dataset
